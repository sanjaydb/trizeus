All these years I am doing research on the following subjects,

1.) Computer forensics investigations.
2.) Ethical Hacking.
3.) Advanced windows debugging.
4.) Advance Linux debugging.
5.) Programming.
6.) Videos.
7.) Network Security.

Most of the work is of my own, However some of the code and examples are
literally as-is-it from the internet or from the book, I have tried to give credit to the Author
or book then and there, If I am missing some one, please let me know,I will update the same.
